# Coding_Quiz
    This porject used html, javascript, and css. I used html to creat different 
    containers to show different parts on the screen. I have two javascrip files.
    One was used to create functions and make the buttons work. The other file
    was used to set up the questions, answers, and options. The user will interact
    with html while java will be changing everything on the screen.
    

    When the webpage is loadded 
    you will be presented with tow buttoms "Start Quiz" and "Saved Score".

    last saved score. This score was saved to local storage. you will have an
    option to close clean and it will take you back to the 2 buttons.
